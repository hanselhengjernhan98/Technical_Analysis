2. __Key Learnings__:
1. MACD
   - Subtracts 26day EMA from 12 day EMA, with signal line the 9 day EMA of the MACD line. When MACD crosses Signal line, 'BUY' due to the momentum. Otherwise, 'short' (downward momentum).

2. RSI
- Get the relative strength (average gain for 14 periods divided by average losses)
- 100 - 1 divided by (1+relative stength)
- RSI crosses 30 towards 70, buy signal.

3. Bollinger Bands
- Get the 20 day moving average of the price and the 20 day std of the price.
- Use the info above to get an upper bound and a lower bound
- If price is towards the upper bound, it indicates a breakout and uptrend(buy). Short if it's on the lower bound.

4. Moving Averages
- Take the 50 day moving average (average of past 50 days) and the 200 day moving average
- When the 50 day moving average crosses the 200 day moving average upward, BUY
- When 200 day moving averge crosses the 50 day moving average downward, SHORT

5. Trendlines
- Trendlines are straight lines that connect two or more price points on a chart, indicating the direction of price movement
- An uptrend line connects higher lows, while a downtrend line connects lower highs
- Trendlines act as dynamic support and resistance levels
- Helps you to buy at the 'low' of the various cycles

6. Resistance
- Often formed by previous lows; the more times the price tests this level without breaking it, the stronger it is considered
